          <p>
            Dedicated front-end developer with over five years of hands-on
            experience in React and JavaScript. Transitioning from a vibrant
            career in music and talent management, I bring a unique blend of
            creativity and technical prowess to software development. Focused on
            good design principles and meticulous attention to detail, I have
            successfully rebuilt websites and streamlined operational processes.
            Proficient in modern libraries like Tailwind and Typescript, I
            specialize in crafting intuitive and visually appealing user
            interfaces, ensuring exceptional user experiences.
            <br />
            <br />
            In my spare time I like to read and write. I love Kurt Vonnegut,
            Stephen King, and Octavia Butler. I'm also a huge weather nerd and
            Twister is my favorite movie.
